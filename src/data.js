    {id: 1, Piece: "The Astronomer", Artist: " Johannes Vemeer", Description: "The scene depicts an astronomer, presumably engrossed in his studies, set against the backdrop of a study or a private room. The astronomer, dressed in a long, fur-trimmed robe, is positioned in the foreground. He leans slightly forward, his left hand resting on a celestial globe while his right hand turns the pages of a large, open book placed on the table before him.

    {id: 2, Piece: "The Wounded Angel", Artist: "Hugo Simberg", Description: "The painting portrays a delicate scene where two young boys are seen carrying a wounded angel on a stretcher. The angel, with her white robe and large, softly feathered wings, is the focal point of the composition. Her head is bowed, and she appears to be in pain or distress. A white cloth bandage covers her eyes, adding a sense of vulnerability and helplessness to her figure. The angel's wings are slightly drooped, reinforcing the sense of injury and sorrow.", URL:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/The_Wounded_Angel_-_Hugo_Simberg.jpg/1920px-The_Wounded_Angel_-_Hugo_Simberg.jpg"},
